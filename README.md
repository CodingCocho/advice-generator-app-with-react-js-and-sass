# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app

![Design preview for the Advice generator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This challenge was completed by Raul Uriostegui Jr on 8-19-2022.
This is the repository that holds my solution. 

# Learning outcomes
This project incorporates React.js and I was able to review useState. In addition I was able to see
the outcome of me first coding challenges with only SASS and HTML as I can now see the utility React.js brings and I can just focus on that now. 

# Challenges
This project posted one challenge and it was working with the API. I am still unsure of understanding of promises and fetch calls which will require more practice with them and more research.
